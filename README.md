# FinalProjectOOPLab

This is my project with my friends, Jonathan Evan Sampurna and Christiano Ekasakti Sangalang.
This project made for our final project of Object Oriented Programming course and we took soccer agenda theme.

Our reason to made and chose this theme is:

Soccer is one of the most hobby and sport that people like in the world. Certainly, to manage the soccer match is hard without a good management. So, we decided to make the program that can manage the soccer match. Our program features are:
- Add matches data, team and player data, and referee data
- View matches data, team and player data, and referee data
- View score of teams which compete in matches and their position
